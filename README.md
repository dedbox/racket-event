Event-lang is a Racket library that simplifies the creation of complex
synchronizable events. It provides a primitive expression-lifting form,

```
> (pure 123)
#<evt>
```

some event combinators,

```
> (sync (fmap + (pure 1) (pure 2)))
3
> (sync (app (pure +) (pure 1) (pure 2)))
3
> (sync (bind (pure 1) (pure 2) (Î» xs (pure (apply + xs)))))
3
```

and a collection of event-friendly alternatives to base Racket forms and
functions.

```
> (sync
   (event-let
    ([x (pure 1)]
     [y (pure 2)])
    (pure (list x y))))
'(1 2)
```

Composite events make progress by synchronizing sub-events, either
concurrently or in a predictable sequence.
